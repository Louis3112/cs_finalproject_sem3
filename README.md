"Our" Final Project for Computational Science (Sains Komputasi) in 3rd Semester.

The project implements various of computational science concepts, such as :
1. Systems of Linear Equation _________________________ *(Sistem Persamaan Linear)*            
2. Practices of Matrix and Equations __________________ *(Praktik Matriks dan Persamaannya)*         
3. Invertible Matrix ____________________________________ *(Inverse Matriks)*        
4. LU Decomposition                           
5. Numeric Method of Linear Equations ______________ *(Metode Numerik Persamaan Linear)*       
6. Numeric Method of Non Linear Equations _________ *(Metode Numerik Persamaan Non-Linear)*    
7. Basic Simulation ____________________________________ *(Dasar-Dasar Simulasi)*                          
8. Iterative Method ____________________________________ *(Metode Iterasi)*                          
9. Monte-Carlo Simulation ____________________________ *(Simulasi Monte-Carlo)*                    
10. Markov Chain _______________________________________ *(Rantai Markov)*                                    

The project is developed using Python, runs on CLI, and requires only a minimal set of packages to install.
For further information, there is a report written in *Bahasa Indonesia* that you can read from
